# JavaOLL
An interpreter for [Our Little Language](https://github.com/basvdl97/OLL-Interpreter), written in Java

## To Use
(Requires that you have Java installed on your computer)

Download the `interpreter.java` file from this repository (or just clone the whole thing if you're feeling fun). Then, using the Shell of your choice, navigate to the directory containing `interpreter.java` and run the following command:

`java interpreter.java /path/to/program`

where `/path/to/program` is replaced with the path to the OLL program you're trying to run. 

I might make a Bash script to automate this process soon.
